Hi, my name is Juan Pablo Mora, welcome to my blog! This is my first attempt at a personal blog, for now I intend to post about whatever I find cool or useful in my day to day, I've played with hacking tools, IoT boards, lots of linux distros and develpment frameworks, all of which I plan to write about. Over time as I get better at writting, this blog should become my personal wiki and journal, which I hope some day will save someone a few debugging hours.

#### 1st. Place Hacking Challenge Winner

For years I've liked the security aspects of technology, but I had nothing to show for it other than some CTF profiles here and there. I got a nice cash prize and a new TV.
